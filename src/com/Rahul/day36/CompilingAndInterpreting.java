// question - Difference b/w compilation and interpretation in java

//Compilation (in Java):
//Takes your Java code (.java)
//Translates it into bytecode (.class)
//This step happens once before running
//If there are mistakes, it stops you right here (so you can fix them)

//Interpretation (in Java):
//Takes that bytecode
//The JVM reads and runs it line by line on your computer
//Happens when you run the program
//If something goes wrong during running (like dividing by 0), you see an error now

public class CompilingAndInterpreting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
